At [EOVE](https://eove.fr), we are designing and manufacturing respiration devices for ventilator dependent patients.

We are lucky to work in an inspiring and challenging domain.

Each of our contributions (design, code, test, manufacturing) has a single goal: **improve the daily life of a patient**.

Our team values are Mutual assistance, Respect, Rigour, Kindness, and Creativity.
