At [EOVE](https://eove.fr), we design and manufacture ventilatory devices for patients with respiratory disease.

We are lucky to work in an inspiring and challenging domain.

Each of our contributions (design, code, test, manufacture) are made with a single goal: improve the daily lives of patients.

Our team values are Mutual assistance, Respect, Rigour, Kindness, and Creativity.
